**1-**

Let $v = (v_t)$ be the relief from the anesthesia and let $c = (c_t)$ be the future costs of the anesthesia on her and the baby's health.

The anesthesia is considered as an immediate rewards and delayed costs. If she chooses to take the anesthesia in period $\tau$, then her intertemporal utility in period $t \le \tau$ is:

$$ 
U_t(\tau) = \begin{cases}  v_\tau - \beta c_\tau\,  & , \space  \space t = \tau \\ 
\beta v_\tau - \beta c_\tau\,  & ,\space  \space t < \tau  \end{cases}
$$
In the model above, we have made the assumption that $\delta = 1$

If she does not choose the anesthesia, then she gets an utility of 0.

**a)**

**i)**

If she is a naive hyperbolic discounter, she mistakenly believes that $\hat\beta = \beta = 1$ when in fact $\beta < \hat\beta = 1$. 

Hence, she will choose to take the anesthesia if 

$$
\hat\beta v_\tau - \hat\beta c_\tau > 0
$$
$$
v_\tau - c_\tau > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is naive, she assumes that her future self will be time-consistent which is not the case. Hence:

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

**iii)**

As we have seen above, she will never worry that her tomorrow self might choose an option that she does not like today.

**b**

**i)**

If she is a sophisticated hyperbolic discounter, she is aware the she is time-inconsistent, hence $\hat\beta = \beta < 1$.

Hence, she will choose to take the anesthesia if 

$$
\beta v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$
$$
\beta(v_\tau -c_\tau) > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is sophisticated, she assumes that her future self will be time-inconsistent. Hence she will take the anesthesia if:

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

**iii)**

It depends on what she wants. If she doesn't want to take the anesthesia before, and then on the moment, she wants to take the anesthesia. Then she wants to commit to a decision beforehand to avoid the time-inconsistency.

**c)**

**i)**

It is the same as under the point a) i), therefore she will choose to take the anesthesia if:

$$
v_\tau - c_\tau > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is naive, she assumes that her future self will be time-consistent. Hence, the same condition applies as under the point a) ii):

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

**iii)**

As she is naive, she will never worry that her tomorrow self might choose an option she does not like today.

**d**

**i)**

If she is a sophisticated hyperbolic discounter, she is aware the she is time-inconsistent, hence $\hat\beta = \beta < 1$.

Hence, she will choose to take the anesthesia if 

$$
\beta v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$
$$
\beta(v_\tau -c_\tau) > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is sophisticated, she assumes that her future self will be time-inconsistent. Hence she will take the anesthesia if:

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

***iii)**

It depends on what she wants. If she doesn't want to take the anesthesia before, and then on the moment, she wants to take the anesthesia. Then she wants to commit to a decision beforehand to avoid the time-inconsistency.
