**a)**

The function maximizing the profit for a firm is:
$$max_p\prod(p) = max_p\delta[(\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})+\int_{\beta\delta b-p}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)]$$
Where:
$\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})$
corresponds to the social surplus that is generated by the interaction between the agent and the firm at t = 0
the second term:
$\int_{\beta\delta b-p}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)$
is the wrong consumers surplus that is reflect by the principle of overconfidence. This term is defined as follows for a time-inconsistent agent:

$F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p)-F(\beta\delta b - p) < 0$ 
which corresponds to the overconfidence. This imply that the agent will consume more than what he expected.

The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Thus, in the case of a time consistent agent where: $\beta=\hat{\beta < 1}$
the right side of the equation is equal to 0, which imply that $p^{*} = a$
In the case of a time-inconsistent agent where $\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1; b < 0$
then we have that $p^{*} > a$

Concerning the value of $L^{*}$
For a firm this value is defined by:
$$\beta\delta[-L+\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b -p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)] = \beta\delta\overline{u}$$
This equation implies that the value optimal value of L is dependent to the participation constrain.
Thus a firm aiming at maximizing its profit will put an L < K in order to use at its advantages the principle of overconfidence from a time-inconsistent agent by attracting him with a lower lump sump fee which will in return be compensate by its consumption.


**b)**
The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Therefore, looking only at time-inconsistent agent as otherwise with $\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1$ leads to $p^{*} = a$
With $b > 0;\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1$, we get that $p^{*} < a$. To compensate, the firm will therefore have lump sump payment that equate to $L^{*} > K$


**c)**
The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Therefore, looking only at time-inconsistent agent as otherwise with $\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1$ leads to $p^{*} = a$
With $b < 0;\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1$, we get that $p^{*} > a$

Because we are in a perfect competition format $p_i = p^{*}$ thus the optimal value of $L{*}$ is defined by 
$$\beta\delta[-L^{*}+\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b -p}(\delta b -p^{*}-c)dF(c)] = \beta\delta\overline{u}$$
if we substitute $L*$ in the maximization profit function we get:
$$max_p\prod(p^{*}) = max_p\delta[(\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p^{*}}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})+\int_{\beta\delta b-p^{*}}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p^{*}}(\delta b -p^{*}-c)dF(c)]$$
Because $L^{*}$ is determined by $\overline{u}$ and in equilibrum $\overline{u}$ expected profit is equal to 0, we have that for 
$\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1;b<0$, $L^{*}>K$
