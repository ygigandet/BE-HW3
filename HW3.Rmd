**4)**

Let's specify the expected utility of each account:

$$
E(u(w_A)) = w
$$
$$
E(u(w_B)) = w *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d)
$$
$$
E(u(w_C)) = (w-e) *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d)
$$

where $w$ = $10'000$, $d$ represents the number of days the money spends in the account and $e$ is the cost of switching from account $A$ to $C$, which is equal to 60.

Before going through the exercise, we can easily estimate that $E(u(w_C)) > E(u(w_B)) > E(u(w_A))$. Hence, she should directly place her money in the account C if she was rational and uility maximizer.

**a)**

We first compute the utility of each account from the first day.

Utility of the account A is given by:
$$
u(w_A) = \beta^d w
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0.9^{10950} * 10'000
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:
$$
u(w_B) = \beta^d w
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0.9^{10950}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*10'950))
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:
$$
u(w_C) = \beta^d (w-e)
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0.9^{10950}(9'940 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*10'950))
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0
$$

So, she would keep the money in the account A because $u(w_A) = u(w_B) = u(w_C)$. However, let's see what she thinks she will do tomorrow. As she is naive, she wrongly assumes that $\hat\beta = \beta = 1$ when in fact $\beta < \hat\beta = 1$.

Utility of the account A is given by:

$$
u(w_A) = \hat\beta^d w_A
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 1^{10949} * 10'000
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 10'000
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:

$$
u(w_B) = \hat\beta^d w_B
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 1^{10949}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*10'949))
$$

$$
u(w_B) = 1^{10949}(10'000 * 1.9)
$$
$$
u(w_B) \approx 18'999
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:

$$
u(w_C) = \hat\beta^d (w_C-e)
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 1^{10949}(9'940 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*10'949))
$$
$$
u(w_C) \approx 24'848.6
$$

Hence, she thinks that tomorrow she will switch from the account A to C because $u(w_C) > u(w_B) > u(w_A)$.

**b)**

She will keep doing this until $0.9^d$ is significantly larger than 0. As we can see in the table below, it will be somehow close to the retirement.

| d         | $0.9^d$       |
| :--:      | :--:          |
| 1         | 0.9^1 = 0.9   |
| 2         | 0.9^2 = 0.81  |
| 3         | 0.9^3 = 0.729 |
| ...       | ...           |
| 10        | 0.9^10 = 0.35 |
| ...       | ...           |
| 20        | 0.9^20 = 0.12 |
| ...       | ...           |
| 30        | 0.9^30 = 0.04 |
| ...       | ...           |
| 50        | 0.9^50 = 0.005|
| ...       | ...           |

When this happens, we know that the accounts B and C are more interesting than the account A with no interest rate. In addition, as there is a cost e from switching from account A to C, there will be a time where the account B is more interesting than the account C due to this transaction cost, which diminish the investment amount by $e$, even if the account C has a bigger return on investment (5% > 3%).

**c)**

For her to change her mind, we need to satisfy the following:

$$ 
\begin{cases} 
u(w_B) > u(w_A) \\ 
u(w_B) > u(w_C)  
\end{cases}
$$
$$ 
\begin{cases} 
0.9^d[10'000(1+\frac{0.03}{365}d)] > 0.9^d * 10'000 \\ 
0.9^d[10'000(1+\frac{0.03}{365}d)] > 0.9^d[9'940(1+\frac{0.05}{365}d)]  
\end{cases}
$$
Therefore, as soon as $0.9^d > 0$ the first equation is always satisfied. Therefore, we need to solve the second equation:

$$
0.9^d[10'000(1+\frac{0.03}{365}d)] > 0.9^d[9'940(1+\frac{0.05}{365}d)]
$$
$$
d < 21'900/197 \approx 111.2 
$$
She will transfer the money to the account B when there will be just 111 days remaining before her retirement. Hence, let's check what happens when there is 111 days remaining:

Utility of the account A is given by:
$$
u(w_A) = \beta^d w
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0.9^{111} * 10'000 - 0
$$
$$
u(w_A) \approx 0.083
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:
$$
u(w_B) = \beta^d w
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0.9^{111}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*111))
$$
$$
u(w_B) \approx 0.084
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:
$$
u(w_C) = \beta^d (w_C - e)
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0.9^{111}(9'940 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*111))
$$
$$
u(w_C) \approx 0.084
$$

Hence, she will switch from the account A to the account B when there would be just 111 days remaining before she retires as $u(w_B) > u(w_C) > u(w_A)$

**d)**

If the cost of transfer $e$ was lower, the naive investor will keep her money longer into account A in the hope she will naively switch to account C tomorrow. But as she is time inconsistent, she will never do it. Hence, she will switch to account B even later.

**e)**

If $\delta$ was lower than 1, the naive investor will keep her money even longer than before into account A. And then she will switch to account B even closer to retirement because the $\delta$ will diminish the value of the investment.
