**4)**

Let's specify the expected utility of each account:

$$
E(u(w_A)) = w
$$
$$
E(u(w_B)) = w *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d)
$$
$$
E(u(w_C)) = w *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d) - e
$$

where $w$ = $10'000$, $d$ represents the number of days the money spends in the account and $e$ is the cost of switching from account $A$ to $C$, which is equal to 60.

Before going through the exercise, we can easily estimate that $E(u(w_C)) > E(u(w_B)) > E(u(w_A))$. Hence, she should directly place her money in the account C if she was rational and uility maximizer.

**a)**

We are in a situation in which costs are immediate and delayed rewards. 

$$ 
u_t(\tau) = \begin{cases} \beta w_\tau\ -e  & , \space  \space t = \tau \\ 
\beta w_\tau\ - \beta e_\tau   & ,\space  \space t < \tau  \end{cases}
$$

where $\beta$ represent the daily discounter.

Hence, we first compute the utility of each account from the first day.

Utility of the account A is given by:
$$
u(w_A) = \beta^d w - e
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0.9^{10950} * 10'000 - 0
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:
$$
u(w_B) = \beta^d w - e
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0.9^{10950}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*10'950)) - 0
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:
$$
u(w_C) = \beta^d w_C - e
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0.9^{10950}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*10'950)) - 60
$$
$$
u(w_C) = -60
$$

So, she would keep the money in the account A because $u(w_A) = u(w_B) > u(w_C)$. However, let's see what she thinks she will do tomorrow. As she is naive, she wrongly assumes that $\hat\beta = \beta = 1$ when in fact $\beta < \hat\beta = 1$.

Utility of the account A is given by:

$$
u(w_A) = \hat\beta^d w_A - \hat\beta e
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 1^{10949} * 10'000 - 1 * 0
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 10'000
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:

$$
u(w_B) = \hat\beta^d w_B - \hat\beta e
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 1^{10949}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*10'949)) - 1*0
$$

$$
u(w_B) = 1^{10949}(10'000 * 1.9) - 1 *0
$$
$$
u(w_B) \approx 18'999
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:

$$
u(w_C) = \hat\beta^d w_C - \hat\beta e
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 1^{10949}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*10'949)) - 1 * 60
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 1^{10949}(10'000 * 2.49) - 1*60
$$
$$
u(w_C) \approx 24'939
$$

Hence, she thinks that tomorrow she will switch from the account A to C because $u(w_C) > u(w_B) > u(w_A)$.

**b)**



**c)**

For her to change her mind, we need to satisfy the following:

$$
u(w_B) \ge u(w_C)
$$
$$
0.9^d(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d)) - 1*0 \ge 0.9^d(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d)) - 0.9 * 60
$$
$$
10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d) \ge 10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d) - 0.9 * 60
$$
$$
54 \ge \frac{10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d)}{10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d)}
$$
$$
54 \ge 1 + \frac{\frac{0.05}{365}}{\frac{0.03}{365}}*d
$$

$$
53 \ge \frac{\frac{0.05}{365}}{\frac{0.03}{365}} * d
$$
$$
53 \ge \frac{5}{3}d
$$
$$
31.8 \ge d
$$
She will transfer the money to the account B when there will be just 31 days remaining before her retirement. Hence, let's check what happens when there is 32 days remaining:

Utility of the account A is given by:
$$
u(w_A) = \beta^d w - e
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0.9^{32} * 10'000 - 0
$$
$$
u(w_A) \approx 343.4
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:
$$
u(w_B) = \beta^d w - e
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0.9^{32}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*32)) - 0
$$
$$
u(w_B) \approx 344.3
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:
$$
u(w_C) = \beta^d w_C - e
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0.9^{32}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*32)) - 60
$$
$$
u(w_C) \approx 284.9
$$

Hence, she will switch from the account A to the account B when there would be just 32 days remaining before she retires.

**d)**

If the cost of transfer $e$ was lower, the naive investor will keep her money longer into account A in the hope she will naively switch to account C tomorrow. But as she is time inconsistent, she will never do it. Hence, it will reduce the number of days before retirement when she will currently switch to account B.
