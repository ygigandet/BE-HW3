Let specify the utility of each account:

$$ 
u(w) = \begin{cases}
w  & , \space  \space if \space A \\ 
w *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}d)  & ,\space  \space if \space B \\
w *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}d) - e& ,\space  \space if \space C
\end{cases}
$$

where $w$ = $10'000$, $d$ represents the number of days the money is in the account and $e$ is the cost of switching from account $A$ to $C$, which is equal to 60.

Therefore, she needs to decide each day if she keeps in $A \in (0, 1)$ or invest $B \in (0,1)$ or $C \in (0,1)$ with the constraint that $A+B+C = 1$

**a)**

We are in a situation in which costs are immediate and delayed rewards. 

$$ 
u_t(\tau) = \begin{cases} \beta w_\tau\ -e  & , \space  \space t = \tau \\ 
\beta w_\tau\ - \beta e_\tau   & ,\space  \space t < \tau  \end{cases}
$$

Hence, we first compute the utility of switching the account right now:

Utility of the account A is given by:
$$
u(w_A) = \beta w_A - e
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0.9^{10950} * 10'000 - 0
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:
$$
u(w_B) = \beta w_B - e
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0.9^{10950}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*10'950)) - 0
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0.9^{10950}(10'000 * 1.9) - 0
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:
$$
u(w_C) = \beta w_C - e
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0.9^{10950}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*10'950)) - 60
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0.9^{10950}(10'000 * 2.5) - 60
$$
$$
u(w_C) = -60
$$

So by looking at it, she would keep the money in the account A. However, let's see if she does it tomorrow:

As she is naive, she wrongly assumes that $\hat\beta = \beta = 1$. 

Account A:

Utility of the account A is given by:
$$
u(w_A) = \beta w_A - \beta e
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 1^{10950} * 10'000 - 1 * 0
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 10'000
$$

Account B:

$$
u(w_B) = \beta w_B - \beta e
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 1^{10949}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*10'949)) - 1*0
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 1^{10949}(10'000 * 1.9) - 1 *0
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 19'000
$$

Account C:

$$
u(w_C) = \beta w_C - \beta e
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 1^{10949}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*10'949)) - 1 * 60
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 1^{10949}(10'000 * 2.49) - 1*60
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 24'938.63
$$

**b)**

For her to change her mind, we need to satisfy the following:

$$
u(w_B) \ge u(w_C)
$$
$$
1^d(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d)) - 1*0 \ge 1^d(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d)) - 1 * 60
$$
$$
10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d) \ge 10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d) - 1 * 60
$$
$$
60 \ge \frac{10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*d)}{10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*d)}
$$
$$
60 \ge \frac{\frac{0.05}{365}*d}{\frac{0.03}{365}*d}
$$

$$
60 \ge \frac{\frac{0.05}{365}*d}{\frac{0.03}{365}*d}
$$
$$
60 \ge \frac{5}{3}d
$$
$$
36 \ge d
$$
She will transfer the money to the account B when there will be just 36 days remaining before her retirement.

Let's check if it works:

Utility of the account A is given by:
$$
u(w_A) = \beta w_A - e
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 0.9^{36} * 10'000 - 0
$$
$$
u(w_A) = 225.284
$$

Utility of the account B is given by:
$$
u(w_B) = \beta w_B - e
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 0.9^{36}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.03}{365}*36)) - 0
$$
$$
u(w_B) = 225.9506
$$

Utility of the account C is given by:
$$
u(w_C) = \beta w_C - e
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 0.9^{36}(10'000 *(1+\frac{0.05}{365}*36)) - 60
$$
$$
u(w_C) = 166.395
$$

Hence, she will switch to B.


**c)**

**d)**

If the cost of transfer $e$ was lower, the naive investor will keep her money longer into account A in the hope she will naively switch to account C tomorrow. But as she is time inconsistent, she will never do it. Hence, it will reduce the number of days before retirement when she will currently switch to account B.
