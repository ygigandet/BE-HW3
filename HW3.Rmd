Let $v = (v_t)$ be the relief from the anesthesia and let $c = (c_t)$ be the future costs of the anesthesia on her and the baby's health.

**One note: if naive, never worry that your tomorrow self might choose an option you do not like today.**

The anesthesia is considered as an immediate rewards and delayed costs. If she chooses to take the anesthesia in period $\tau$, then her intertemporal utility in period $t \le \tau$ is:

$$ 
U_t(\tau) = \begin{cases}  v_\tau - \beta c_\tau\,  & , \space  \space t = \tau \\ 
\beta v_\tau - \beta c_\tau\,  & ,\space  \space t < \tau  \end{cases}
$$
In the model above, we have made the assumption that $\delta = 1$

If she is a naive hyperbolic discounter, she mistakenly believes that $\hat\beta = \beta = 1$ when in fact $\beta < \hat\beta = 1$. 

Hence, she will
