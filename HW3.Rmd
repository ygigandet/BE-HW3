Let $v = (v_t)$ be the relief from the anesthesia and let $c = (c_t)$ be the future costs of the anesthesia on her and the baby's health.

The anesthesia is considered as an immediate rewards and delayed costs. If she chooses to take the anesthesia in period $\tau$, then her intertemporal utility in period $t \le \tau$ is:

$$ 
U_t(\tau) = \begin{cases}  v_\tau - \beta c_\tau\,  & , \space  \space t = \tau \\ 
\beta v_\tau - \beta c_\tau\,  & ,\space  \space t < \tau  \end{cases}
$$
In the model above, we have made the assumption that $\delta = 1$

If she does not choose the anesthesia, then she gets an utility of 0.

**a)**

**i)**

If she is a naive hyperbolic discounter, she mistakenly believes that $\hat\beta = \beta = 1$ when in fact $\beta < \hat\beta = 1$. 

Hence, she will choose to take the anesthesia if 

$$
\hat\beta v_\tau - \hat\beta c_\tau > 0
$$
$$
v_\tau - c_\tau > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is naive, she assumes that her future self will be time-consistent which is not the case. Hence:

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

**iii)**

As we have seen above, she will never worry that her tomorrow self might choose an option that she does not like today.

**b**

**i)**

If she is a sophisticated hyperbolic discounter, she is aware the she is time-inconsistent, hence $\hat\beta = \beta < 1$.

Hence, she will choose to take the anesthesia if 

$$
\beta v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$
$$
\beta(v_\tau -c_\tau) > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is sophisticated, she assumes that her future self will be time-inconsistent. Hence she will take the anesthesia if:

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

**iii)**

It depends on what she wants. If she doesn't want to take the anesthesia before, and then on the moment, she wants to take the anesthesia. Then she wants to commit to a decision beforehand to avoid the time-inconsistency.

**c)**

**i)**

It is the same as under the point a) i), therefore she will choose to take the anesthesia if:

$$
v_\tau - c_\tau > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is naive, she assumes that her future self will be time-consistent. Hence, the same condition applies as under the point a) ii):

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

**iii)**

As she is naive, she will never worry that her tomorrow self might choose an option she does not like today.

**d)**

**i)**

If she is a sophisticated hyperbolic discounter, she is aware the she is time-inconsistent, hence $\hat\beta = \beta < 1$.

Hence, she will choose to take the anesthesia if 

$$
\beta v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$
$$
\beta(v_\tau -c_\tau) > 0
$$

**ii)**

As she is sophisticated, she assumes that her future self will be time-inconsistent. Hence she will take the anesthesia if:

$$
v_\tau - \beta c_\tau > 0
$$

**iii)**

It depends on what she wants. If she doesn't want to take the anesthesia before, and then on the moment, she wants to take the anesthesia. Then she wants to commit to a decision beforehand to avoid the time-inconsistency.

**a)**

Let $u = (u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4) = (3, 5, 8, 13)$ be the utility that she gets from watching each movie for $t = 1, 2, 3, 4$.

Therefore, her discounted utility from the perspective of time $t$ is given by:

$$
U_t = u_t + \beta(u_{t+1} + u_{t+2} + u_{t+3} + ...)
$$

Because Alice is naive, she wrongly believes that she is time-consistent, in other words: $\hat\beta$ = $\beta$ = 1. Therefore, she will plan on watching the last movie because $u_4 > u_3 > u_2 > u_1$. In reality she will chose the third movie because:    

Summary of discounted utilities with $\beta$ = 0.5 and $\delta$ = 1:

|t = 3      |       |               | 8            | 0.5*13 = 6.5 | 3,4     |

Therefore we can see that:

- At t = 1, she prefers to watch the movie during the week 4, thus she does not go to the first movie:
$2.5 < 3 < 4 < 6.5 = u_2 < u_1 < u_3 < u_4$

- At t = 2, she still prefers to watch the movie during the week 4, thus she does not watch the second film. 
$4 < 5 < 6.5 = u_3 < u_2 < u_4$

- At t = 3, she perceives a higher utility in watching the movie during the week 3 rather than during the week 4.
$6.5 < 8 = u_4 < u_3$

**b)**

Because Alice is sophisticated, she knows that she is time-inconsistent, in other words: $\hat\beta$ = $\beta$ < 1.

Sophisticated people perfectly anticipate the behaviors of their future selves (anticipate they will not stick to the plans) and take this into consideration in their choices over time by using backward induction. Therefore


- At t = 3, she prefers to watch the movie in the third week because:
$6.5 < 8 = u_4 < u_3$

- At t = 2, she knows that she will choose to watch the movie during the week 3 instead of the week 4. Therefore, she compares it with her current view:
$4 < 5 = u_3 < u_2$
Thus, she prefers to watch the movie in the second week.

- At t = 1, with the same principle as above, she compares it with her current view:
$2.5 < 3 = u_2 < u_1$
Thus, she prefers to watch the movie in the first week.

In conclusion, if Alice is sophisticated, she will watch the movie during the first week.

**c)**

Naive Alice gets 3 ticket, therefore:

- At t = 1, she plans to miss the movie on week 2 and therefore watch the movie on week 1:
$2.5 < 3 < 4 < 6.5 = u_2 < u_1 < u_3 < u_4$

- At t = 2, she plans to miss the movie on week 3 and therefore watch the movie on week 2:
$4 < 5 < 6.5 = u_3 < u_2 < u_4$

- At t = 3, she watches the movie on week 3 and therefore miss the one from week 4:
$6.5 < 8 = u_4 < u_3$

**d) **

Sophisticated Alice gets 3 ticket, therefore:


- At t = 2, she prefers to watch the movie on week 2, 3 and 4:
$4 < 5 < 6.5 = u_3 < u_2 < u_4$

- At t = 1, she prefers to switch the second movie by the first one as:
$2.5 < 3 < 4 < 6.5 = u_2 < u_1 < u_3 < u_4$
Thus, she prefers to miss the second movie.

**e)**

If an economist believes that $\beta = 1$, we have the following utility function for Alice:

$$
U_t = u_t + \delta u_{t+1} + \delta^2u_{t+2} + \delta^3u_{t+3} + ...
$$

$$
U_t = \sum_{\tau = 0}^{\infty} \delta^\tau u_{t+\tau}
$$

Therefore, to find the biggest $\delta$ that an agent with exponential discounting could have such that he would choose the same 3 movies as naive Alice (in other words, movies from the first three weeks)

- At t = 1, if we want Alice to watch the first movie, we must satisfy the following inequation:
$3 > \delta*5$ <=> $\delta < \frac{3}{5}$

- At t = 2, if we want Alice to watch the second movie, we must satisfy they following inequation:
$5 > \delta*8$ <=> $\delta < \frac{5}{8}$

- At t = 3, if we want Alice to watch the third movie, we must satisfy they following inequation:
$8 > \delta*13$ <=> $\delta < \frac{8}{13}$

Hence, $\delta$ < min($\frac{3}{5}$, $\frac{5}{8}$, $\frac{8}{13}$) = $\frac{3}{5}$

**a)**

The function maximizing the profit for a firm is:
$$max_p\prod(p) = max_p\delta[(\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})+\int_{\beta\delta b-p}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)]$$
Where:
$\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})$
corresponds to the social surplus that is generated by the interaction between the agent and the firm at t = 0
the second term:
$\int_{\beta\delta b-p}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)$
is the wrong consumers surplus that is reflect by the principle of overconfidence. This term is defined as follows for a time-inconsistent agent:

$F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p)-F(\beta\delta b - p) < 0$ 
which corresponds to the overconfidence. This imply that the agent will consume more than what he expected.

The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Thus, in the case of a time consistent agent where: $\beta=\hat{\beta < 1}$
the right side of the equation is equal to 0, which imply that $p^{*} = a$
In the case of a time-inconsistent agent where $\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1; b < 0$
then we have that $p^{*} > a$

Concerning the value of $L^{*}$
For a firm this value is defined by:
$$\beta\delta[-L+\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b -p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)] = \beta\delta\overline{u}$$
This equation implies that the value optimal value of L is dependent to the participation constrain.
Thus a firm aiming at maximizing its profit will put an L < K in order to use at its advantages the principle of overconfidence from a time-inconsistent agent by attracting him with a lower lump sump fee which will in return be compensate by its consumption.


**b)**
The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Therefore, looking only at time-inconsistent agent as otherwise with $\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1$ leads to $p^{*} = a$
With $b > 0;\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1$, we get that $p^{*} < a$. To compensate, the firm will therefore have lump sump payment that equate to $L^{*} > K$


**c)**
The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Therefore, looking only at time-inconsistent agent as otherwise with $\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1$ leads to $p^{*} = a$
With $b < 0;\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1$, we get that $p^{*} > a$

Because we are in a perfect competition format $p_i = p^{*}$ thus the optimal value of $L{*}$ is defined by 
$$\beta\delta[-L^{*}+\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b -p}(\delta b -p^{*}-c)dF(c)] = \beta\delta\overline{u}$$
if we substitute $L*$ in the maximization profit function we get:
$$max_p\prod(p^{*}) = max_p\delta[(\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p^{*}}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})+\int_{\beta\delta b-p^{*}}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p^{*}}(\delta b -p^{*}-c)dF(c)]$$
Because $L^{*}$ is determined by $\overline{u}$ and in equilibrum $\overline{u}$ expected profit is equal to 0, we have that for 
$\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1;b<0$, $L^{*}>K$
