**1-**
In this situation we have the following variables:
Labour = payoff = $V$; anesthesia = effort = $e$, cost of effort = $c(e)$; Knowledge over the fact that she will face pain = $\theta$
where:
$$c(e) = \begin{cases} c > 0, & \mbox{if } e =1 \\ c = 0, & \mbox{if } e = 0 \end{cases}$$

**a)**
i) she would decide to not take anesthesia
ii) she would predict that she will not take the anesthesia since she believes that she is rational $\beta = \hat{\beta} = 1$
iii)

**b)**
i) she would decide to not take anesthesia
ii) she would predict that she will not take the anesthesia since $\beta = \hat{\beta}$
iii)

**c.)** 
$\beta = 1$

**d.)** 
$\hat{\beta} = \beta$
