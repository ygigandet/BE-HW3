In this situation we have the following variables:
Birth = payoff = $V$; Labour = effort = $e$, Pain = cost of effort = $c(e)$; Knowledge over the fact that she will face pain = $\theta$
where:
$$c(e) = \begin{cases} c > 0, & \mbox{if } e =1 \\ c = 0, & \mbox{if } e = 0 \end{cases}$$

- i) she would decide to not take anesthesia
- ii) she would predict that she will not take the anesthesia since she believes that she is rational: 
$\beta = \hat{\beta} = 1$
- iii)

**b)**
- i) she would decide to not take anesthesia
- ii) she would predict that she will not take the anesthesia since $\beta = \hat{\beta}$
- iii)

**c.)** 
$\beta = 1$

**d.)** 
$\hat{\beta} = \beta$

**a)**
It is inconsistent because for exponential discounting, preference are constant over time for an individual, thus in theory individual should not chose the option of going through H&R Block, as the utility between "now" and in 1 "week" is the same, and because the gain is diminished when tax prepare service are used, an individual will wait instead. 
Another way would be to check if the discount factor $\delta$ is constant over time, if not we can sefely assume that there exist inconsistency. We are going to compare immediate gain, of 2000/12 USD with gains in 4-6-12 months.
$Present\ value = PV = 2000/12$; $Future \space Value = FV = 2000/3; 2000/1$;
with $\delta = \frac{PV}{2}$
we have :
$$\delta_4 = (\frac{2000/12}{2000/3})^3 \approx 0.01565 \\; \space \delta_6 = (\frac{2000/12}{2000/2})^2 \approx 0.027 \\; \space \delta_{12} = (\frac{2000/12}{2000})^1 \approx 0.0833  $$

**b)**
hyperbolic discounting individuals have a dis-utility regarding future gains. This means that they have extract more value over immediate gain over long. Therefore, because the first option imply a gain by small monthly paycheck, the value associate to each new payment is becoming lowever over time instead of staying consistent. This explain why they choose the second option. The second inconsistency is in regard to the solicitation of a tax preparer, which imply a negative impact on their overall utility. In summary, these individual are displaying impatient choice in regard to future beneficial gain, yet chose less attractive option for immediate utility gain.

a time consistent agent with $\delta = 1;\space \beta = 1$ would chose the 4th movie since $u_1 < u_2 < u_3 < u_4$

a)
Because Alice is naive, she wrongly believes that she knows her future self, thus $\hat{\beta} = \beta = 1$, therefore, she will plan on watching the last movie. In reality she will chose the third movie because: 
summary of discounted utilities with $\beta = 0.5$:

| t         | t = 0 |     t = 1     |     t = 2    |    t = 3     | Ranking |

|t = 0      | 3     | 0.5*5 = 2.5   | 0.5*8 = 4    | 0.5*13 = 6.5 | 2,3,1,0 |

|t = 1      |       | 5             | 0.5*8 = 4    | 0.5*13 = 6.5 | 2,3,1,  |

|           |       |               |              |              |         |
|From self  |       |               |              |              |         |
|t = 2      |       |               | 8            | 0.5*13 = 6.5 | 1,2     |
|perspective|       |               |              |              |         |

Therefore we can see that:

- T = 0, she prefers to watch the 4th movie, thus she does not go to the first movie. 
$2.5_{u_2} < 3_{u_1} < 4_{u_3} < 6.5_{u_4}$
- T = 1, she still prefers the 4th movie, thus she does not go the the second film. 
$4_{u_3} < 5_{u_2} < 6.5_{u_4}$
- T = 2, she perceived a higher utility in watching the 3rd movie now rather than wait for the last week 
$8_{u_3} > 6.5_{u_4}$

b) 
a sophisticate agent $\hat{\beta} = \beta$
if she is sophisticated the, we have to look at the value backwards. The best option for Alice in :
- T = 2 is to watch the movie in T = 2 because $8>6.5$
- T = 1, because Alice knows that she will choose the 3d movie instead of the 4th one, she compares with her best choice. In this case it's to watch the 2nd movie, because $5 > 4$
- T = 1, with the same principle she compares her prediction and decide to watch the first movie because $3 > 2.5$

she now gets 3 ticket:

- t = 1, she chooses $u_2, u_3, u_4$
- t = 0, she chooses $u_1, u_2, u_3$

c)
- t = 0 she chooses $u_1, u_3, u_4$
- t = 1 she chooses $u_2, u_3, u_4$
therefore, she misses the 1st movie

d)
as seen in the second part of point b, she chooses $u_1, u_2, u_3$, therefore, she miss the 4th movie.

a)
at t = 0 a time-inconsistent agent decide to consume C with probability:
$F(\delta b - p)$
However at t = 1, the agent will choose C with probability:
$F(\beta\delta b - p)$
Thus the difference of:
$F(\delta b - p) - F(\beta\delta b - p)$
Corresponds to the "over consumption", meaning that the agent will consume more that what he anticipates. Because:
$F(\delta b - p) < F(\beta\delta b - p)$


For a firm, in this set up:
if: $\beta = 1 \space or\space b = 0$
Thus meaning the agent is time consistent, then the profit maximizing contract for th firm $(L^{*}, p^{*})$ has per-usage price thee value: 
$p^{*} = a$ 
and a lump sump fee of:
$L^{*} = K$
This is the case for both investment goods and Leisure goods

b)
In the case of an investment goods then:

a)

The function maximizing the profit for a firm is:
$$max_p\prod(p) = max_p\delta[(\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})+\int_{\beta\delta b-p}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)]$$
Where:
$\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})$
corresponds to the social surplus that is generated by the interaction between the agent and the firm at t = 0
the second term:
$\int_{\beta\delta b-p}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)$
is the wrong consumers surplus that is reflect by the principle of overconfidence. This term is defined as follows for a time-inconsistent agent:

$F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p)-F(\beta\delta b - p) < 0$ 
which corresponds to the overconfidence. This imply that the agent will consume more than what he expected.

The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Thus, in the case of a time consistent agent where: $\beta=\hat{\beta < 1}$
the right side of the equation is equal to 0, which imply that $p^{*} = a$
In the case of a time-inconsistent agent where $\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1; b < 0$
then we have that $p^{*} > a$

Concerning the value of $L^{*}$
For a firm this value is defined by:
$$\beta\delta[-L+\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b -p}(\delta b -p-c)dF(c)] = \beta\delta\overline{u}$$
This equation implies that the value optimal value of L is dependent to the participation constrain.
Thus a firm aiming at maximizing its profit will put an L < K in order to use at its advantages the principle of overconfidence from a time-inconsistent agent by attracting him with a lower lump sump fee which will in return be compensate by its consumption.


b)
The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Therefore, looking only at time-inconsistent agent as otherwise with $\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1$ leads to $p^{*} = a$
With $b > 0;\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1$, we get that $p^{*} < a$. To compensate, the firm will therefore have lump sump payment that equate to $L^{*} > K$


c)
The first order condition  for the firm maximization profit is:
$$p^{*} -a = -(1-\hat{\beta})\delta b\frac{f(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}-\frac{F(\hat{\beta}\delta b -p^{*})-F(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}{f(\beta\delta b -p^{*})}$$
Therefore, looking only at time-inconsistent agent as otherwise with $\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1$ leads to $p^{*} = a$
With $b < 0;\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1$, we get that $p^{*} > a$

Because we are in a perfect competition format $p_i = p^{*}$ thus the optimal value of $L{*}$ is defined by 
$$\beta\delta[-L^{*}+\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b -p}(\delta b -p^{*}-c)dF(c)] = \beta\delta\overline{u}$$
if we substitute $L*$ in the maximization profit function we get:
$$max_p\prod(p^{*}) = max_p\delta[(\int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p^{*}}(\delta b-a-c)dF(c)-K-\overline{u})+\int_{\beta\delta b-p^{*}}^{\hat{\beta}\delta b-p^{*}}(\delta b -p^{*}-c)dF(c)]$$
Because $L^{*}$ is determined by $\overline{u}$ and in equilibrum $\overline{u}$ expected profit is equal to 0, we have that for 
$\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1;b<0$, $L^{*}>K$
